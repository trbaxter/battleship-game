Create an arrayList, named "locationCells", that will contain objects of type String.
The access modifier of private is used so the locations can't be adjusted once the game begins.
This will represent the positions of a battleship on the grid.

The locationCells arrayList is set using the setLocationCells setter method.
The name of the ship is set using the setName setter method.

The user's guess is passed into the checkYourself() method, where a "Miss!" is the default result to a guess.
We find out if the user's guess is found in the arrayList by using the .indexOf() method.
If it's in locationCells, an index value of 0, 1, or 2 is returned. If it isn't in locationCells, a -1 is returned.

An if-loop runs if the index is within the arrayList, starting off by removing the index so the same spot can't be hit.
If all 3 cells in the arrayList are removed, a message is displayed to the user saying they sunk a ship.
If only a single cell in the arrayList is removed, a message is displayed to the user saying they hit a ship.

Whether a hit or a miss occurs, the result is returned at the end of the method.
